# Super Buy Bonus Mode System

## Overview
The Super Buy allows the player to spend in-game currency to enter a bonus mode where multiple balls are automatically dropped into multiplier bins.

This system handles economy validation, UI updates, game state transitions, automated gameplay, and camera control.

## Purchase Logic
The Super Buy button is only enabled when the player's balance is greater than or equal to the Super Buy cost.

BalanceAfterPurchase = CurrentBalance - SuperBuyCost

If the purchase is valid:
- The cost is subtracted from the balance
- Balance UI text updates
- Super Buy button state updates
- Bonus mode begins



## Bonus Mode Trigger
After purchase:
1. The main game is disabled
2. Bonus mode state is activated
3. Camera transitions to the SuperBuy view
4. Automated ball drop sequence begins


## Automated Ball Drop 
- A total of 10 balls are spawned automatically
- Balls are released sequentially with a timed delay
- Physics determines ball movement into multiplier bins

This removes player input and focuses on reward randomness.


## Multiplier Bin Logic
Each bin applies a multiplier to the reward value:

FinalReward = BaseValue × BinMultiplier

The total payout is accumulated across all 10 balls.


## Camera Control
During bonus mode:
- Camera smoothly transitions to a fixed SuperBuy angle

---

## Bonus Completion
When all balls finish:
- Total reward is calculated and shown on a reward UI box 
- Balance is updated
- UI reflects the new balance
- Game returns to normal pinball mode
